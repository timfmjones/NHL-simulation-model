**NHL Game Simulator**

run  `python train_model.py`

run `python game_simulator.py`

Will randomly select two NHL teams and run a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) of a single game.



Discrete event simulation (DES) is a modeling technique used to represent the operation of a system as a sequence of distinct events, where each event occurs at a particular point in time and changes the state of the system. It is commonly used to analyze complex systems in various fields such as manufacturing, telecommunications, and logistics by simulating the interactions and processes over time to evaluate performance and optimize operations.
